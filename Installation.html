        <h5>Collaboration with Quanzhu Ma. Burnt wood, pyrography, acrylic and pencil on plywood, strings, paper on floor. approx.240x200x15cm </h5>
        <p>Dialogues is an exhibition featuring works by MFA Drawing students from stage 1 and stage 2. By working in pairs or groups, the students explored shared themes in their projects, fostering dialogue even when connections weren't immediately obvious. They collaborated both directly and indirectly on the artworks, enabling an exchange of ideas, mutual learning, and strengthening the Drawing Masters community.</p>

        <p>My work started with exploring the relationship between the 2D forms and 3D structures. It leads to a big concept about connecting real space and illusionary space. My final work showing here is a play of visual space in layers.</p>

    <h3>Up the stairs</h3>

    <h5>Tape, Ladder, Books of Cinema, Colored pins, Steel rod, Wood.</h5>
    <p>Up the stairs is a site-specific work exhibited at Articulate Project Space in Feb, 2021. It is a part of the group project Proximity for NAS Drawing Week 2021.</p>
    <p>The work was developed in a week and continued work on site, inspired by the unique long stairs connecting the ground gallery space to the second-floor studio corridor. The image shows the work located above and on the opposite wall of the original stairs.</p>
    <p>Up the stairs explores the continuity of the real world into the illusionary space by mirroring the structure around. It plays space relationships both visually and intellectually.</p>
