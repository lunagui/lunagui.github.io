    <h2>About Luna</h2>
    <p>Email: guiliying@gmail.com</p>
    <p>Living and working in Sydney Australia, Luna Gui is a multidisciplinary artist primarily working in painting and installation. Influenced by post-minimalist movements from the 1990s onward, her work explores the formal language of painting and takes a critical approach to the medium. Focused on studying the perception of visual space, her paintings are often presented as objects in which color, shape, and line spill into the physical space. Luna frequently constructs custom objects to manifest specific artistic concepts. Through the process of creation and observation, her work continually evolves through an ongoing dialogue, often leading to new series.
      </p>
    <p>In 2022, Luna received the John Olsen Prize for Drawing (Highly Commended). In 2023, she completed her Bachelor of Fine Art degree with a major in Painting at the National Art School in Sydney. Currently, Luna is pursuing a Master’s degree in Fine Art while actively exhibiting with her fellow artists.
