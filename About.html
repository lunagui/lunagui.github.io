    <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
    <p>Luna Gui is an artist based in Sydney, Australia, working at the intersection of painting, object-making, and installation. Influenced by post-minimalist and formalist traditions, her practice investigates spatial perception through constructed forms and a reduced visual language. 
</p>
<p>Her recent work explores perceptual play—experiments in how vision constructs space. Each piece brings form, colour, line, structure, and shadow into relation as elements of spatial events, where seeing becomes a process of continual reorganisation. Drawing on Gestalt principles, visual instability, and optical illusion, her work stages oscillations between figure and ground, surface and depth, transforming perception from observation into experience. 
</p>
<p>Often responding to architectural sites, Luna’s installations explore how form and environment co-produce spatial meaning, prompting shifts in how we encounter and read space. Her process is iterative and research-driven, guided by acts of building, observing, and adjustment—where each work emerges from and extends an ongoing inquiry into the construction of perceived space.

    <h2>Artist Bio</h2>
<p>Luna Gui (b. 1978) holds an MFA and a BFA (Painting) from the National Art School in Sydney. Her MFA research project, Seeing Depth: Perception and Phenomenology of Space, established the conceptual foundation for her ongoing investigation into the construction of perceived space.</p>
<p>Luna has exhibited widely within Sydney’s independent contemporary art scene. Key exhibitions include the NAS Postgrad Show, Derivatives (solo), and ABORA 4: Fourth Australian Biennale of Reductive Arts. She is the recipient of the John Olsen Prize for Drawing (Highly Commended), and her work is held in both private and public collections.</p>
<p>She is currently developing a two-year research program, Gestalt and Beyond: Constructing Perceived Space, which extends her inquiry into spatial perception through studio experimentation, installation, and international residency engagement.</p>
